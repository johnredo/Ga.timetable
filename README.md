Genetic algorithm used to solve University Course Timetabling Problems

This software was created for an international exchange as a research project, in which we planned to use AI (a genetic algorithm) to create better automated schedules for new students at college. 

We took hard and soft constraints based on the necesities at our university.

This solution aims to solve a very specific problem in my college, we tried it with "in code" variables, but it can be modified to get them from a data base or any data source.
